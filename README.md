# The Rotor Field Theory: A Geometric Framework for Physics

A theoretical framework proposing that spacetime, matter, and cosmological phenomena can be described through a fundamental bivector field in geometric (Clifford) algebra.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

**The Central Idea**: What if spacetime geometry isn't fundamental, but emerges from a more primitive structure—a "rotor field" R(x,t) = exp(½B(x,t)) where B is a bivector (oriented plane element)?

**What this framework demonstrates**:
- Einstein's field equations can be obtained as effective dynamics of the rotor-induced metric
- Quantum spinors are geometric objects (even multivectors), not abstract entities
- Dark matter may be rotor field components misaligned with electromagnetic observation planes
- Dark energy arises from rotor vacuum state

**Status**: Independent theoretical research. Contains novel testable predictions (gravitational wave sidebands, lensing quadrupoles, CMB correlations). Requires peer review and experimental validation.

## Overview

This repository contains a research program exploring whether general relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmological phenomena can emerge from bivector field dynamics in geometric algebra.

### The Rotor Field Postulate

**Central Postulate**: Physical spacetime admits a bivector field B(x,t) whose exponential R(x,t) = exp(½B(x,t)) defines a rotor field R: M → Spin(1,3). Observable structures—metric geometry, matter fields, dynamics—are proposed to arise from this rotor field's kinematics and dynamics.

This is analogous to Einstein postulating metric tensor g_μν as fundamental. Here we propose the bivector field B as more primitive, with the metric emerging as g_μν = e_μ^a e_ν^b η_ab where e_a = R γ_a R̃.

### What Can Be Derived

Within this framework, the following can be obtained as mathematical consequences:

**Classical Physics**
- Einstein's field equations: G_μν = 8πG T_μν^(RF)
- Newton's laws: F = ma, τ = dL/dt (low-amplitude limit)
- Maxwell's equations: ∇F = J (electromagnetic bivector)

**Quantum Physics**
- Dirac equation: (iℏγ^μ∂_μ - mc)ψ = 0 (single-particle rotor)
- Spin-½: geometric property of even subalgebra
- Pauli equation: spin in magnetic field

**Thermodynamics**
- Second law: dS/dt ≥ 0 (rotor H-theorem from phase diffusion)

**Cosmology**
- Inflation: slow-roll dynamics with n_s ≈ 0.965
- Dark energy: rotor vacuum with equation of state w ≥ -1
- Dark matter: phase-dephased bivector component B_⊥

## Key Predictions

### Novel Predictions (Not Yet Observed)

#### 1. Gravitational Wave Sidebands
**Prediction**: Precessing binary systems exhibit phase-modulation sidebands:
```
f_sideband = f_orbital ± n·Ω_prec,  n = 1,2,...
A_n ∝ (Ω_prec/f_orbital)^n · f_α(χ_eff)
```

**Target**: LIGO/Virgo events with χ_eff > 0.3, SNR ≥ 15
**Signature**: Δχ² ≥ 10 improvement over non-precessing templates
**Status**: Requires dedicated template development and GWTC analysis

#### 2. CMB Parity Violation
**Prediction**: Chiral bivectors produce TB/EB correlations:
```
C_ℓ^TB ∝ f_chiral · C_ℓ^TE
```

**Current limit**: |C_ℓ^TB|/C_ℓ^TE < 0.1 (Planck)
**Future sensitivity**: ~10^(-3) (Simons Observatory, CMB-S4)
**Status**: Would be smoking gun for rotor inflation

#### 3. Dark Matter Lensing Quadrupoles
**Prediction**: Weak lensing mass distributions show quadrupole aligned with galactic angular momentum:
```
ε₂ = (κ_major - κ_minor)/(κ_major + κ_minor) ~ 10^(-3) to 10^(-2)
```

**Test**: Stack ~10⁴ spiral galaxies (LSST, Euclid)
**Null test**: Face-on disks (i < 20°) should show ε₂ → 0
**Status**: **This is the most accessible near-term test**

#### 4. Rotation Curve Correlations
**Prediction**: Rotor vortex strength v_R² correlates with:
- Disk thickness h/R (thicker → weaker vortex)
- Specific angular momentum L_spin
- Tidal field alignment (cosmic web)

**Dataset**: SPARC rotation curves (~175 galaxies currently, ~10⁵ with SKA)
**Analysis**: Multivariate regression testing v_R² ∝ f(h/R, L_spin, τ_LSS)
**Status**: Can be tested with existing data

### Consistency Checks (Reproducing Known Physics)

#### 5. Cosmological Parameters
**Reproduces**:
- Spectral index: n_s = 0.9649 ± 0.0042 (Planck 2018) ✓
- Dark energy: w₀ = -1.03 ± 0.03 (consistent with w = -1) ✓
- Tensor suppression: r < 0.06 (rotor: r ≲ 0.001) ✓

#### 6. Particle Physics Scales
**Explains (post-diction)**:
- Top quark mass: m_t ≈ 173 GeV ≈ M_*^(EW) = v/√2 = 174 GeV
- Top Yukawa: y_t = m_t√2/v ≈ 0.995 ≈ 1 (saturates natural scale)
- QCD scale: M_*^(QCD) ~ 200 MeV (flux tube-bag crossover)

**Note**: These are not predictions but consistency checks showing the framework accommodates known values.

---

## Falsification Criteria

**This framework will be considered falsified if:**

### 1. Lensing Quadrupoles (Primary Test)
❌ LSST stacking of 10⁴ spiral galaxies shows:
- ε₂ < 10^(-4) at 3σ level, OR
- No correlation between quadrupole orientation and photometric position angle

**Timeline**: LSST Year 3+ (2027-2028)
**Confidence**: If this fails, rotor dark matter is ruled out

### 2. Gravitational Wave Sidebands
❌ Einstein Telescope (2030s) observes 100+ precessing binaries with SNR > 50:
- No sidebands detected at > 3σ using matched filtering
- Upper limits on A₁/A₀ < 10^(-3) inconsistent with rotor coupling

**Timeline**: 2035+
**Caveat**: Non-detection is ambiguous (could mean weak coupling)

### 3. CMB TB Correlations
❌ CMB-S4 constrains:
- |C_ℓ^TB/C_ℓ^TE| < 10^(-4) at all multipoles ℓ = 30-3000

**Timeline**: 2030-2035
**Confidence**: Would rule out chiral rotor inflation

### 4. Dark Energy Phantom Crossing
❌ Future observations (Roman, Euclid) confirm at > 5σ:
- w(z) < -1 for any redshift z

**Timeline**: 2028-2030
**Confidence**: Would definitively falsify rotor dark energy (predicts w ≥ -1 always)

### 5. Rotation Curve Null Test
❌ SPARC + SKA multivariate analysis shows:
- No correlation between v_R² and disk geometry (p > 0.1)
- MOND fits data better (Bayesian evidence ratio > 100)

**Timeline**: Available now (SPARC), 2030+ (SKA)

**The theory is falsifiable.** Specific observations can rule it out with high confidence.

## Comparison with Alternative Theories

| Feature | Rotor Field | String Theory | Loop Quantum Gravity | MOND/TeVeS | Scalar Field DM |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Unifies gravity + QM** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Explains dark matter** | ✓ (dephasing) | ? (landscape) | ✗ | ✓ (modified grav) | ✓ (axions/fuzzy) |
| **Explains dark energy** | ✓ (vacuum) | ? (landscape) | ✗ | ✗ | Depends on potential |
| **Testable predictions** | ✓ (5 specific) | ✗ (no accessible energy) | ✓ (Immirzi) | ✓ (rotation curves) | ✓ (direct detection) |
| **Free parameters** | ~3-5 | >500 | ~2 | ~2 | ~2-5 |
| **Bullet Cluster** | ✓ (collisionless B_⊥) | N/A | ✗ | ✗ (fails) | ✓ |
| **Renormalizable** | Likely (needs proof) | ✓ (perturbatively) | Non-perturbative | ✗ | ✓ |
| **GW speed c_GW = c** | ✓ (GW170817) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ (TeVeS fails) | ✓ |
| **Development stage** | Early (needs peer review) | 50+ years | 40+ years | 40+ years | 30+ years |

**Key Distinctions**:
- **vs String Theory**: Rotor theory makes testable predictions at accessible energies (GW, CMB, galaxies), not just at Planck scale
- **vs LQG**: Rotor explains dark sectors; LQG does not
- **vs MOND**: Rotor reproduces Bullet Cluster (collisionless dark matter); MOND fails
- **vs Scalar DM**: Rotor predicts lensing quadrupoles aligned with angular momentum; scalar DM does not

## Scale Hierarchy

The rotor stiffness M_* exhibits hierarchical structure:

```
M_*^(Pl)  ~ 2.18 × 10^18 GeV   Planck scale (gravitational)
M_*^(inf) ~ 10^13 - 10^16 GeV  Inflationary scale
M_*^(EW)  ~ 174 GeV            Electroweak (≈ top mass m_t)
M_*^(QCD) ~ 200 MeV            QCD confinement
```

**Origin**: Proposed to emerge from renormalization group flow of rotor coupling α(μ). Full derivation requires quantum field theory treatment (see `renormalization.tex`).

**Observational consequence**: Different scales dominate in different regimes:
- **Cosmology**: M_*^(inf) sets inflationary dynamics
- **Particle physics**: M_*^(EW) and M_*^(QCD) set electroweak and strong scales
- **Quantum gravity**: M_*^(Pl) sets Planck scale

---

## Mathematical Framework

### Geometric Algebra Foundations
- **Clifford algebra** Cl(1,3) with basis {γ_μ} satisfying γ_μγ_ν + γ_νγ_μ = 2η_μν
- **Bivectors**: B = ½B^μν γ_μ ∧ γ_ν (6-dimensional space, isomorphic to Lie algebra so(1,3))
- **Rotors**: R = exp(½B) ∈ Spin(1,3) (double cover of Lorentz group SO⁺(1,3))

### Field Equations

**Tetrad construction**:
```
e_a(x) = R(x) γ_a R̃(x)
```
where R̃ denotes reversion (adjoint operation in geometric algebra).

**Induced metric** (emergent, not fundamental):
```
g_μν = e_μ^a e_ν^b η_ab
```

**Action**:
```
S = ∫ [α/2 ⟨∇_μR ∇^μR̃⟩₀ + M_*²/4 ⟨Ω_μΩ^μ⟩₀ - V(R)] √(-g) d⁴x
```
where ⟨·⟩₀ denotes scalar part (grade-0 projection) and Ω_μ is the spin connection.

**Field equations** (from variation):
1. **Einstein equations**: G_μν = 8πG T_μν^(RF)
2. **Rotor dynamics**: □Φ + V_{,Φ}/α = 0 (Klein-Gordon for rotor phase)
3. **Torsion-free**: ∇[μ e_a ν] = 0 (Levi-Civita connection)

**Stress-energy tensor**:
```
T_μν^(RF) = (M_*²/4)[⟨Ω_μΩ_ν⟩₀ - ½g_μν⟨Ω_αΩ^α⟩₀]
            + α∂_μΦ∂_νΦ - g_μν[α/2(∂Φ)² - V]
```

## Correspondence Limits

| Regime | Limit | Recovers |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Weak field, slow motion | \|B\| ≪ 1, v/c ≪ 1 | Newtonian gravity: ∇²Φ = 4πGρ |
| Single particle | m² potential | Dirac equation: (iℏγ^μ∂_μ - mc)ψ = 0 |
| Classical spin | ℏ → 0 (effective) | Euler equations: dL/dt = τ |
| Early universe | Homogeneous R(t) | Slow-roll inflation |
| Late universe | Ṙ → 0, V ≈ V₀ | ΛCDM with w = -1 |
| Dephased sector | c_R² → 0, σ_B → 0 | Cold dark matter (collisionless) |
| Electromagnetic coupling | B aligned with EM plane | Luminous (visible) matter |

**Key insight**: Standard physics emerges in limiting cases. Deviations occur when rotor structure becomes important (high curvature, quantum regime, cosmological scales).

- Novel framework requires extensive review
- Need to demonstrate advantage over existing theories

**Success metric**: At least 2 papers accepted in peer-reviewed journals

### Phase 2: Community Engagement (2027-2030)

**Contingent on peer-review acceptance**, seek collaboration with:

**Gravitational waves**:
- LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA: Propose sideband search in O5 data
- Target: High-SNR precessing binaries (χ_eff > 0.3)

**Weak lensing**:
- LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration

- CMB-S4 (2030s): TB correlations to 10^(-3) sensitivity
- LSST completed (2033): Full quadrupole analysis
- SKA Phase 2 (2030s): 10⁵ rotation curves

**Possible outcomes**:
1. ✅ **Confirmation**: Quadrupoles detected, sidebands observed → Strong evidence for rotor theory
2. ❌ **Falsification**: Null results at required sensitivity → Theory ruled out
3. 🤷 **Ambiguous**: Partial evidence, needs next-generation instruments

**Realistic timeline**: Definitive test by **2035** (lensing quadrupoles are earliest accessible prediction).

## Open Issues and Limitations

### Theoretical Challenges

#### 1. Renormalizability
**Issue**: While power-counting suggests the theory is renormalizable in 3+1 dimensions (dimension-2 kinetic term, dimension-4 potential), explicit loop calculations have not been performed.

**Open question**: What are the β-functions? Does the theory have a UV fixed point or is it asymptotically free?

**Status**: Requires quantum field theory analysis (planned for follow-up work)

#### 2. Initial Conditions
**Issue**: The theory does not explain why the bivector field B(x,t) has particular initial values during inflation. What set Φ(t₀) and Φ̇(t₀)?

**Possible answer**: Kibble-Zurek mechanism during earlier phase transition sets domain structure, but this is speculative.

**Status**: Same problem as standard inflation (initial conditions are boundary conditions, not derived)

#### 3. Coupling Constants
**Issue**: Fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137, strong coupling αₛ, gravitational constant G are input parameters, not derived from rotor field invariants.

**Speculative idea**: Topological invariants like ∫⟨K²⟩ d⁴x (rotor curvature squared) might determine dimensionless couplings, analogous to instanton contributions in QCD.

**Status**: Hand-waving at this stage, needs rigorous development

#### 4. Cosmological Singularities
**Issue**: Near Big Bang or black hole singularities, perturbative expansion R ≈ 1 + ½B breaks down. Can the full nonlinear rotor equation ∇_μ∇^μR = R δV/δR̃ resolve singularities?

**Status**: Requires numerical relativity simulations with rotor field matter

### Observational Tensions

#### 1. Dark Matter Sound Speed
**Constraint**: Lyman-α forest requires c_R² ≲ 5×10^(-10)

**Implication**: Bivector orientation dispersion σ_B must be extremely small: σ_B ≲ 2×10^(-5)

**Tension**: Such small dispersion seems fine-tuned. Why is rotor field so well-aligned?

**Possible resolution**: Phase transition in early universe created coherent bivector state (analogous to ferromagnetic alignment), but mechanism unclear.

#### 2. Tensor Suppression
**Prediction**: f_B ~ 10^(-12) for Planck-scale stiffness M_* ~ M_Pl

**Consequence**: Primordial gravitational waves essentially undetectable (r ~ 10^(-13))

**Question**: If r < 10^(-3) is confirmed by future CMB, does this validate rotor theory or is it unfalsifiable? Need to identify M_* regime that gives r ~ 10^(-3) to 10^(-2) (detectable but suppressed).

#### 3. Why This Bivector Decomposition?
**Assumption**: Dark matter is B_⊥ (orthogonal to EM observation plane)

**Question**: Why does this decomposition occur? What physical process causes dephasing between B_∥ and B_⊥?

**Speculative answer**: Reheating after inflation produces bivector orientations, electromagnetic fields select measurement basis, orthogonal components appear dark. But this is not rigorous.

### Comparison with Competitors

#### 1. Could Standard Model + ΛCDM Reproduce Everything?
**Yes, for consistency checks** (n_s, w₀, particle masses): These are post-dictions, not predictions.

**No, for novel predictions** (lensing quadrupoles aligned with angular momentum, GW sidebands): Standard model does not predict these.

**Critical test**: Lensing quadrupoles. If detected → rotor theory has explanatory advantage. If not detected → rotor DM falsified.

#### 2. Could Modified Gravity (MOND) Explain Galaxies Better?
**MOND advantages**: Fewer parameters, Tully-Fisher relation
**MOND failures**: Bullet Cluster, cluster mass profiles, cosmology

**Rotor theory**: Reproduces MOND-like behavior in galaxies (rotation curves) while avoiding Bullet Cluster problem (collisionless B_⊥ component).

**Test**: If rotation curve correlations with disk geometry are found, rotor theory explains why MOND works where it does.

#### 3. Could Scalar DM (Axions, Fuzzy DM) Be Simpler?
**Yes**: Scalar field is simpler than bivector field.

**But**: Scalar DM does not predict lensing quadrupoles aligned with angular momentum. This is unique to rotor (bivector) structure.

**Test**: If quadrupoles are detected → bivector nature is required, scalar field insufficient.

---

## Philosophical Framework (Optional Reading)

### On the Nature of Spacetime

The rotor field hypothesis suggests spacetime geometry is not fundamental but **emergent** from bivector field dynamics, similar to how:
- Temperature emerges from molecular motion (thermodynamics)
- Spacetime emerges from quantum entanglement (ER=EPR conjecture)
- Fluid mechanics emerges from particle collisions (hydrodynamics)

**Question**: Is the bivector field B(x,t) "real" or merely a mathematical device?

**Physical realism**: Electromagnetic field F_μν, initially Maxwell's theoretical construct, is now regarded as physically real (carries energy, momentum). Perhaps bivector field is similarly fundamental.

**Structural realism**: What matters is not ontology but structure—the pattern of relationships among observables. Bivectors encode geometric relationships constituting spacetime.

### Geometric Algebra as Physical Language

Clifford (1878): *"The distinctness of vector and scalar quantities is fundamental to the nature of space."*

Hestenes (1966): *"Geometric algebra provides a unified language for the whole of physics."*

**Hypothesis**: Perhaps geometric algebra is not just notation but encodes fundamental operations by which nature processes information and generates observable phenomena.

**If true**: Rotor field is nature's way of "computing" spacetime geometry from more primitive bivector states.

**If false**: Still useful as mathematical tool, even if not ontologically fundamental.
