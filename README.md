# The Rotor Field Hypothesis: Unifying Matter, Information, and Motion

A comprehensive theoretical framework proposing that rotors (elements of geometric algebra) form the fundamental substrate of physical reality, from which classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum kinematics, thermodynamics, and learning emerge.

## Overview

This repository contains the research paper and supporting code for the Rotor Field Hypothesis. The hypothesis postulates that:

- Physical states are represented as rotor fields R(x,t) in geometric algebra
- All conserved currents arise from geometric products of rotor gradients
- Classical and quantum phenomena emerge from different linearization regimes
- Information processing and thermodynamic entropy share a common geometric origin

## Paper

The main paper (`rotor_field_hypothesis.tex`) presents:

- **Kinematic postulates**: Rotor field representation and geometric operations
- **Dynamic framework**: Action principle and equations of motion
- **Mathematical foundations**: Geometric algebra operations, Noether-type invariants, energy functionals
- **Emergent phenomena**: Classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum kinematics, thermodynamics, and learning
- **Experimental predictions**: Testable consequences in gravitational waves, ML priors, and signal compression

### Compilation

To compile the LaTeX document:

```bash
pdflatex rotor_field_hypothesis.tex
```

The output will be `rotor_field_hypothesis.pdf`.

## Repository Structure

The complete reproducibility program is organized into four modules:

- **rotor-core/**: Core geometric algebra library implementing rotor operations, gradients, and conservation laws
- **rotor-compress/**: Signal compression experiments using rotor-based representation
- **rotor-ml/**: Machine learning implementations with SO(3)-equivariant rotor regularization
- **rotor-grav/**: Gravitational wave analysis tools for detecting rotor-induced sidebands

## Key Predictions

1. **Gravitational-wave sidebands**: Phase-modulation sidebands around binary merger signals
2. **Rotor-inductive ML priors**: Improved performance on rotation-heavy tasks (point clouds, molecular dynamics)
3. **Compression of cyclic signals**: Better compression ratios for periodic data
